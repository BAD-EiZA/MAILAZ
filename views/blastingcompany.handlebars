                  <p style="margin:0 0 14px 0;">
                    First of all, thanks so much for taking the time to read my email. I was doing some research for IELTS providers in <strong>{{city}}</strong>, and came across your company, <strong>{{name}}</strong>. I think our goals for student success align really well!
                  </p>

                  <p style="margin:0 0 14px 0;">
                    Please allow me to introduce myself. I am Liva, the CEO of <strong>Atlaz Test Center</strong>. Atlaz is an EdTech company that scaled our technology to an international level. We are now trusted by institutions worldwide for our highly accurate, automated evaluation tools that bridge the gap between preparation and results.
                  </p>

                  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
                    Looking at your business and all the products we’ve developed, I wanted to pick out something that would actually be a good fit for you. I’d love to introduce the <strong>Atlaz IELTS Prediction Test</strong>. It’s built to fit right into your current programs and save your team from a lot of the manual workload.
                  </p>

                    <li style="margin:0 0 8px 0;">
                      <strong>Instant AI Feedback:</strong> We’ve built the AI to handle the hardest parts: Writing and Speaking, giving students instant scores that actually match real IELTS standards.
                    </li>
                    <li style="margin:0 0 8px 0;">
                      <strong>Real Exam Vibes:</strong> The whole experience is 100% online and designed to feel exactly like the actual test, which really helps students shake off those exam-day nerves.
                    </li>
                    <li style="margin:0 0 8px 0;">
                      <strong>Practice That Works:</strong> Students can jump in and practice up to 15 times, so they aren’t just guessing. They’re building real confidence before they pay for the official exam.
                    </li>
                    <li style="margin:0 0 0 0;">
                      <strong>Give Your Teachers Their Time Back:</strong> The system handles the grading automatically. This takes the heavy manual workload off your trainers so they can spend their energy on actual teaching instead of marking papers.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
